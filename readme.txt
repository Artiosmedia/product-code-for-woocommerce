This plugin will allow a user to add a unique internal product identifier in addition to the GTIN, EAN, SKU or UPC throughout the order process. No setup, small memory footprint and concise results.

== Description ==

This is a very simple plugin that many website designers and business owners look for. The need to add a product identifier to each or some items in Woocommerce. A code used internally for inventory, which would be ideal for order fulfillment referenced from each item ordered. A code that can be seen by the public if desired, or turned off if not.

Often a website designer or company owner simply wants to add an internal product code to their WooCommerce build. A code that is in addition to the GTIN, EAN, SKU and UPC throughout the order process. However, all current plugin add-on provisions entail complex setups and functions which result in extra memory usage, system conflicts and frequent updates. This plugin eliminates all the hurdles by providing a simple solution without excessive options.

Simply install, enter your product codes within each product post and publish. Nothing more to it than that! If you don't want the public to see the unique product code, the user side display can be turned off in setup.

The added field is compliant to mappable data import and export schemes. This same compliance allows the field to be included in a Google Merchant product feed, if mapped during the feed setup using any number of third party plugins. Language support include: English, Spanish and French.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Enter the Product Code under the SKU from either Variable or Simple products.

== Using in Multisite Installation ==

1. Extract the zip file contents in the wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation. (This is not created by default. You must create it in the wp-content folder.) The 'mu' does not stand for multi-user like it did for WPMU, it stands for 'must-use' as any code placed in that folder will run without needing to be activated.
2. Access the Plugins settings panel named 'Product Code for WooCommerce' under options.
3. Enter the Product Code under the SKU from either Variable or Simple products.
